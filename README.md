# franka_pivot_control

This is a component in the research project _EndoMersion_
targeting advanced laparoscopic image viewing in VR and camera work using head gestures.
This library provides a robot controller for [Franka Emika Panda](https://www.franka.de/robot-system/) to move the robot holding the laparoscope or any laparoscopic tool,
so that it moves fast but smoothly around the entry hole (pivot point).
The controller is based on [frankx](https://github.com/pantor/frankx).
